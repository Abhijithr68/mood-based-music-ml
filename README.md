# üéµ Mood-Based Music Recommendation System --- EMOTUNES

## üöÄ Project Description

The **Mood-Based Music Recommendation System -- EMOTUNES** is a full-stack web application that detects a user's emotional state using machine learning and recommends songs tailored to that mood through the **Spotify API**. The app captures a snapshot from the user's webcam, processes the image using deep learning techniques, and classifies the mood (e.g., happy, sad, neutral, angry). Based on this classification, a relevant playlist is provided.

This system features secure **user authentication** (signup/login), with credentials stored in an **SQLite3 database** and passwords encrypted using **bcrypt**. It offers a modern and interactive UI built with **React.js**, while the backend is developed using **Flask**, **TensorFlow**, and **OpenCV**.
